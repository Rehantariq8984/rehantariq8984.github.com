	<h1><ul><strong>WHO BOUGHT TOYOTA CAR FIRST?</strong></ul></h1>
	<h3><li><b>ONE OF THE GREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD</b>
     	The first person to buy a Toyota car would likely have been a customer in Japan shortly after Toyota began producing automobiles. Toyota's automotive division traces its roots back to the establishment of the Toyota Motor Corporation in 1937. The company initially produced its first passenger car, the Toyota Model AA, in 1936, and it went on sale to the public in 1937.

Given that the Model AA was Toyota's first passenger car, the first customer to purchase one would have been among the earliest buyers of a Toyota car. However, due to the passage of time and the lack of specific records, it's challenging to determine the identity of the very first individual to buy a Toyota car.</li></h3>
